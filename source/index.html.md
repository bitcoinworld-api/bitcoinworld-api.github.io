# Introduction

## API Introduction

Welcome to Huobi Korea API！  

This is the official Huobi Korea API document, and will be continue updating, please follow us to get latest news.

You can switch to different API business in the top menu, and switch to different language by clicking the button in the top right.

The example of request and response is showing in the right hand side.

## Market Maker Program

It is very welcome for market maker who has good market making strategy and large trading volume. If your Huobi Spot account or Contract account has at least 10 BTC, you can send your email to:

- [MM-hk@bitv.com](mailto:MM-hk@bitv.com) for Hong Kong (spot) market maker

And provide below details:

1. UID (not linked to any rebate program in any accounts)
2. Screenshot of trading volume in other transaction platform (such as trading volume within 30 days, or VIP status)
3. A brief description of your market-making strategy 

<aside class="notice">

</aside>

## Contact Us

If you have any questions or inquiries using API, please refer to the `Inquiry Q&A` or join the `Huobi Korea API Communication Telegram Group` (http://bit.ly/2lY4o7v) for consultation. 

# Quick Start

## Preparation

Before you use API, you need to login the website to create API Key with proper permissions.

You can manage your API Key <a href='https://www.huobi.co.kr/en-us/api/'>here</a>.

Every user can create at most 20 API Key, each of them has three permissions:

- Read permission: It is used to query the data, such as order query, trade query.
- Trade permission: It is used to create order, cancel order and transfer, etc.
- Withdraw permission: It is used to create withdraw order, cancel withdraw order, etc.

Please remember below information after creation:

- `Access Key`  It is used in API request
  
- `Secret Key`  It is used to generate the signature (only visible once after creation)

<aside class="notice">
The API Key can bind maximum 20 IP addresses, we strongly suggest you bind IP address for security purpose. The API Key without IP binding will be expired after 90 days.
</aside>
<aside class="warning">
<red><b>Warning</b></red>: These two keys are important to your account safety, please don't share <b>both</b> of them together to anyone else. If you find your API Key is disposed, please remove it immediately.
</aside> 

## SDK and Demo

**SDK (Suggested)**

[Java](https://github.com/huobiapi/huobi_Java) | [Python3](https://github.com/huobiapi/huobi_Python) | [C++](https://github.com/huobiapi/huobi_Cpp) | [C#](https://github.com/HuobiRDCenter/huobi_CSharp) | [Go](https://github.com/huobirdcenter/huobi_golang)

**Other Demos**

https://github.com/huobiapi?tab=repositories

## Testnet (Stopped)

The testnet has been alive for months, however the active user count is rather low and the cost is high, after considering carefully we decide to shutdown the testnet environment.

It is suggest you use live environment, which is more stable and has more liquidity.

## Interface Type

There are two types of interface, you can choose the proper one according to your scenario and preferences.

### REST API

REST (Representational State Transfer) is one of the most popular communication mechanism under HTTP, each URL represents a type of resource.

It is suggested to use Rest API for one-off operation, like trading and withdraw.

### WebSocket API

WebSocket is a new protocol in HTML5. It is full-duplex between client and server. The connection can be established by a single handshake, and then server can push the notification to client actively.

It is suggest to use WebSocket API to get data update, like market data and order update.

**Authentication**

Both API has two levels of authentication:

Public API: It is for basic information and market data. It doesn't need authentication.

Private API: It is for account related operation like trading and account management. Each private API must be authenticated with API Key.

## Access URLs
You can compare the network latency between two domain <u>api-cloud.huobi.co.kr</u> and <u>api-cloud.huobi.co.kr</u>(AWS Tokyo), and then choose the better one for you.

In general, the domain <u>api-aws.huobi.co.kr</u> is optimized for AWS client, the latency will be lower.

**REST API**

**`https://api.huobi.co.kr`**  

**`https://api-aws.huobi.co.kr`**  

**Websocket Feed (market data except MBP incremental)**

**`wss://api.huobi.co.kr/ws`**  

**`wss://api-aws.huobi.co.kr/ws`**  

**Websocket Feed (market data only MBP incremental)**

**`wss://api.huobi.co.kr/feed`**  

**`wss://api-aws.huobi.co.kr/feed`**  

**Websocket Feed (account and order)**

**`wss://api.huobi.co.kr/ws/v1`**  

**`wss://api-aws.huobi.co.kr/ws/v1`**     

<aside class="notice">
Please initiate API calls with non-China IP.
</aside>
<aside class="notice">
It is not recommended to use proxy to access Huobi API because it will introduce high latency and low stability.
</aside>
<aside class="notice">
It is recommended to access Huobi API from AWS Japan for better stability. If your server is in China mainland, it may be not stable.
</aside> 

## Authentication

### Overview

The API request may be tampered during internet, therefore all private API must be signed by your API Key (Secrete Key).

Each API Key has permission property, please check the API permission, and make sure your API key has proper permission.

A valid request consists of below parts:

- API Path: for example <u>api-cloud.huobi.co.kr/v1/order/orders</u>
- API Access Key: The 'Access Key' in your API Key
- Signature Method: The Hash method that is used to sign, it uses **HmacSHA256**
- Signature Version: The version for the signature protocol, it uses **2**
- Timestamp: The UTC time when the request is sent, e.g. 2017-05-11T16:22:06. It is useful to prevent the request to be intercepted by third-party.
- Parameters: Each API Method has a group of parameters, you can refer to detailed document for each of them. 
  - For GET request, all the parameters must be signed.
  - For POST request, the parameters needn't be signed and they should be put in request body.
- Signature: The value after signed, it is guarantee the signature is valid and the request is not be tempered.

### Signature Method

The signature may be different if the request text is different, therefore the request should be normalized before signing. Below signing steps take the order query as an example:

This is a full URL to query one order:

`https://api-cloud.huobi.co.kr/v1/order/orders?`

`AccessKeyId=e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx`

`&SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256`

`&SignatureVersion=2`

`&Timestamp=2017-05-11T15:19:30`

`&order-id=1234567890`

#### 1. The request Method (GET or POST, WebSocket use GET), append line break “\n”


`GET\n`

#### 2. The host with lower case, append line break “\n”

`api-cloud.huobi.co.kr\n`

#### 3. The path, append line break “\n”

`
/v1/order/orders\n
`

#### 4. The parameters are URI encoded, and ordered based on ASCII

For example below is the original parameters:

`AccessKeyId=e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx`

`order-id=1234567890`

`SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256`

`SignatureVersion=2`

`Timestamp=2017-05-11T15%3A19%3A30`

<aside class="notice">
Use UTF-8 encoding and URI encoded, the hex must be upper case. For example, The semicolon ':' should be encoded as '%3A', The space should be encoded as '%20'.
</aside>
<aside class="notice">
The 'timestamp' should be formated as 'YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss' and URI encoded.
</aside>

Then above parameter should be ordered like below:


`AccessKeyId=e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx`

`SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256`

`SignatureVersion=2`

`Timestamp=2017-05-11T15%3A19%3A30`

`order-id=1234567890`

#### 5. Use char  “&” to concatenate all parameters


`AccessKeyId=e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx&SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256&SignatureVersion=2&Timestamp=2017-05-11T15%3A19%3A30&order-id=1234567890`

#### 6. Assemble the pre-signed text

`GET\n`

`api-cloud.huobi.co.kr\n`

`/v1/order/orders\n`

`AccessKeyId=e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx&SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256&SignatureVersion=2&Timestamp=2017-05-11T15%3A19%3A30&order-id=1234567890`


#### 7. Use the pre-signed text and your Secret Key to generate a signature

- Use the pre-signed text in above step and your API Secret Key to generate hash code by HmacSHA256 hash function.
- Encode the hash code with base-64 to generate the signature.

`4F65x5A2bLyMWVQj3Aqp+B4w+ivaA7n5Oi2SuYtCJ9o=`

#### 8. Put the signature into request URL

- Put all the parameters in the URL
- Append the signature in the URL, with parameter name “Signature”.

Finally, the request sent to API should be:

`https://api-cloud.huobi.co.kr/v1/order/orders?AccessKeyId=e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx&order-id=1234567890&SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256&SignatureVersion=2&Timestamp=2017-05-11T15%3A19%3A30&Signature=4F65x5A2bLyMWVQj3Aqp%2BB4w%2BivaA7n5Oi2SuYtCJ9o%3D`

For WebSocket interface:

1. Fill the value according to required JSON schema
2. The value in JSON doesn't require URL encode

For example:

`{
    "action": "req", 
    "ch": "auth",
    "params": { 
        "authType":"api",
        "accessKey": "e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx",
        "signatureMethod": "HmacSHA256",
        "signatureVersion": "2.1",
        "timestamp": "2019-09-01T18:16:16",
        "signature": "4F65x5A2bLyMWVQj3Aqp+B4w+ivaA7n5Oi2SuYtCJ9o="
    }
}`

## Sub User

Sub user can be used to isolate the assets and trade, the assets can be transferred between parent and sub users. Sub user can only trade with the sub user. The assets can not be transferred between sub users, only parent user has the transfer permission.  

Sub user has independent login password and API Key, they are managed under parent user in website.

Each parent user can create **200** sub user, each sub user can create at most **5** API Key, each API key can have two permissions: **read** and **trade**.

The sub user API Key can also bind IP address, the expiry policy is the same with parent user.

You can access <a href='https://www.huobi.co.kr/en-us/sub-account/'>here</a> to create and manage sub user.

The sub user can access all public API (including basic information and market data), below are the private APIs that sub user can access:

## Glossary

### Trading symbols

The trading symbols are consist of base currency and quote currency. Take the symbol `BTC/USDT` as an example, `BTC` is the base currency, and `USDT` is the quote currency.  

The corresponding field of the base currency is base-currency.

The corresponding field of the quote currency is quote-currency.

### Account

The `account-id` defines the Identity for different business type, it can be retrieved from API `/v1/account/accounts` , where the `account-type` is the business types.
The types include:

* spot: Spot account
* point: Point card account

### Identity

* order-id: The unique identity for order.
* client-order-id: The identity that defined by client. This id is included in order creation request, and will be returned as order-id. This id is valid within 24 hours. The allowed characters are letters (case sensitive), digit, underscore (_) and hyphen (-), no more than 64 chars.
* match-id : The identity for order matching.
* trade-id : The unique identity for the trade.

### Order Type
The order type is consist of trade direction and order classification. Take `buy-market` as an example, the trade direction is `buy`, the operation type is `market`.  

Trade direction includes:

* buy
* sell  

Order classification includes:

* limit: Both of the price and amount should be specified in order creation request.
* market : The price is not required in order creation request, you only need to specify either money or amount. The matching and trade will happen automatically according to the request.
* limit-maker: The price is specified in order creation request as market maker. It will not be matched in the matching queue.
* ioc: ioc stands for "immediately or cancel", it means the order will be canceled if it couldn't be matched. If the order is partially traded, the remaining part will be canceled.
* stop-limit: The price in order creation request is the trigger price. The order will be put into matching queue only when the market price reaches the trigger price.

### Order Status

* submitted: The order is submitted, and already in the matching queue, waiting for deal.
* partial-filled: The order is already in the matching queue and partially traded, and is waiting for further matching and trade.
* filled: The order is already traded and not in the matching queue any more.
* partial-canceled: The order is not in the matching queue any more. The status is transferred from 'partial-filled', the order is partially trade, but remaining is canceled.
* canceled: The order is not in the matching queue any more, and completely canceled. There is no trade associated with this order.
* canceling: The order is under canceling, but haven't been removed from matching queue yet.

# API Access

## Overview

Category| URL Path | Description 
--------- | --------- | -----------
Common |/v1/common/* | Common interface, including currency, currency pair, timestamp, etc 
Market Data |/market/*| Market data interface, including trading, depth, quotation, etc 
Account |/v1/account/*  /v1/subuser/* | Account interface, including account information, sub-account ,etc 
Order |/v1/order/* | Order interface, including order creation, cancellation, query, etc 

Above is a general category, it doesn't cover all API, you can refer to detailed API document according to your requirement.

## New Version Rate limit Rule

- Only those endpoints marked with rate limit value and a bracketed 'NEW' are applied with new rate limit rule.<br>
- The new version rate limit is applied on UID basis, which means, the overall access rate, from all API keys under same UID, to single endpoint, shouldn’t exceed the rate limit applied on that endpoint.<br>
- It is suggested to read HTTP Header `X-HB-RateLimit-Requests-Remain` and `X-HB-RateLimit-Requests-Expire` to get the remaining count of request and the expire time for current rate limit time window, then you can adjust the API access rate dynamically.<br>

## Rate Limiting Rule

Except those endpoints which are marked with new rate limit value separately, following rate limit rules are applicable -

* Each API Key is limited to 10 times per second
* If API Key is empty in request, then each IP is limited to 10 times per second

For example

* Order interface is limited by API Key: no more than 10 times within 1 sec
* Market data interface is limited by IP: no more than 10 times within 1 sec

## Request Format

The API is restful and there are two method: GET and POST.

* GET request: All parameters are included in URL
* POST request: All parameters are formatted as JSON and put int the request body

## Response Format

The response is JSON format.There are four fields in the top level: `status`, `ch`, `ts` and `data`. The first three fields indicate the general status, the business data is is under `data` field.

Below is an example of response:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "ch": "market.btcusdt.kline.1day",
  "ts": 1499223904680,
  "data": // per API response data in nested JSON object
}
```

Field| Data Type | Description 
--------- | --------- | -----------
status    | string    | Status of API response 
ch        | string    | The data stream. It may be empty as some API doesn't have data stream 
ts        | int       | The UTC timestamp when API respond, the unit is millisecond 
data      | object    | The body data in response 

## Data Type

The JSON data type described in this document is defined as below:

- `string`: a sequence of characters that are quoted
- `int`: a 32-bit integer, mainly used for status code, size and count
- `long`: a 64-bit integer, mainly used for Id and timestamp
- `float`: a fraction represented in decimal format, mainly used for volume and price, recommend to use high precision decimal data types in program

## Best Practice

### Security

- It is strongly suggested to bind your IP with your API Key to ensure that your API Key can only be used in your machine. Furthermore, your API Key will be expired after 90 days if it is not binded with any IP.
- It is strongly suggested not to share your API Key with any body or third-party software, otherwise your personal information and asset may be stolen. If your expose your API Key by accident, please do delete the API Key and create a new one.

### General

**API Access**

- It is suggested not to use temporary domain or proxy, which may be not stable.
- It is suggested to use AWS Japan to access API for lower latency
- It is suggested to connect to domain `api-aws.huobi.co.kr` if your server is based on AWS, because this domain is optimized for AWS client, the latency will be lower.

**New Version Rate limit Rule**

- Only those endpoints marked with rate limit value separately are applied with new rate limit rule.
- It is suggested to read HTTP Header `X-HB-RateLimit-Requests-Remain` and `X-HB-RateLimit-Requests-Expire` to get the remaining count of request and the expire time for current rate limit time window, then you can adjust the API access rate dynamically.
- The overall access rate, from all API keys under same UID, to single endpoint, shouldn’t exceed the rate limit applied on that endpoint.

### Market

**Market data**

- It is suggested to use WebSocket interface to subscribe the market update and then cache the data locally, because WebSocket notification has lower latency and not have rate limit.
- It is suggested not to subscribe too many topics in a single websocket connection, it may generate more notifications and cause network latency and disconnection.

**Latest trade**

- It is suggested to subscribe WebSocket topic `market.$symbol.trade.detail`, the response field `price` represents the latest price, and it has lower latency.
- It is suggested to use `tradeId` to de-duplicate if you subscribe WebSocket topic `market.$symbol.trade.detail`.

**Depth**

- It is suggested to subscribe WebSocket topic `market.$symbol.bbo` if you only need the best bid and best offer.
- It is suggested to subscribe WebSocket topic `market.$symbol.depth.$type` if you need multiple bid and offer with normal latency.
- It is suggested to subscribe WebSocket topic `market.$symbol.mbp.$level` if you need multiple bid and offer with lower latency
- It is suggested to use `version` field to de-duplicate and discard the smaller data if you use Rest interface `/market/depth` and WebSocket topic `market.$symbol.depth.$type`. It is suggest to use `seqNum` to de-duplicate and discard the smaller data if yo subscribe WebSocket topic `market.$symbol.mbp.$levels`.

### Order

**Place an order (/v1/order/orders/place)**

- It is suggested to follow the symbol reference (`/v1/common/symbols`) to validate the amount and value before placing the older, otherwise you may place an invalid order and waste your time.
- It is suggested to provide an unique `client-order-id` field when placing the order, it is useful to track your orders status if you fail to get the order id response. Later you can use the `client-order-id` to match the WebSocket order notification or query order detail by interface `/v1/order/orders/getClientOrder`.

**Search history olders (/v1/order/orders)**

- It is recommended to use `start-time` and `end-time` to query, that are two timestamps with 13 digits (millisecond). The maximum query time window is 48 hours (2 days), the more precision you provide, the better performance you will get. You can query for multiple iterations. 

**Order update**

- It is suggested to subscribe WebSocket topic `orders.$symbol.update`, which has lower latency and more accurate sequence.
- It is suggested not to subscribe WebSocket topic `orders.$symbol`,which is replaced by `orders.$symbol.update`, and will be retired later.

### Account

**Asset update**

- It is suggested to subscribe both WebSocket topic `orders.$symbol.update` and `account.update#${mode}`. The former one tells the order status update and arrives earlier than the latter one, and the latter one confirms the final asset balance.
- It is suggested not to subscribe WebSocket topic `accounts`, which is replaced by `accounts.update#${mode}`, and will be retired later.

# Frequently Asked Questions

Huobi will publish API announcement in advance for any API change, please subscribe our announcements so that you can get latest update. 

How to subscribe: Click <a href='https://support.huobi.co.kr/hc/ko/sections/360007543852-API-%EA%B3%B5%EC%A7%80%EC%82%AC%ED%95%AD'>link</a>, click "Follow" button in the top right of the page, then choose the type you want to follow. After you subscribe, the button will changed to "Following". If you don't have any account, you need to register first. 

## Access and Authentication

### Q1：How many API Keys one user can apply?
A:  Every user can create 5 API Keys, and each API Key can be granted with 3 permissions: **read**, **trade** and **withdraw**.
Each user could create up to 200 sub users, and each sub user could create 5 API Keys, each API key can be granted with 2 permissions: **read** and **trade**.

Below are the explanation for permissions:

1、Read permission: It is used to query data, for example, **query orders**, **query trades**. 

2、Trade permission: it is used to **place order**, **cancel order** and **transfer**.

3、Withdraw permission: it is used to **withdraw**, **cancel withdraw**.

### Q2：Why APIs are always disconnected or timeout?
A：Please follow below suggestions:

1、It is unstable if the client's server locates in China mainland, it is suggested to invoke API from a server at AWS Japan.

2、It is suggested to invoke API only to host <u>api-cloud.huobi.co.kr</u> or <u>api-was.huobi.co.kr</u>.

### Q3：Why the WebSocket is often disconnected?
A：Please check below possible reasons:

1、The client didn't respond 'Pong'. It is requird to respond 'Pong' after receive 'Ping' from server.

2、The server didn't receive 'Pong' successfully due to network issue.

3、The connection is broken due to network issue.

4、It is suggested to implement WebSocket re-connect mechanism. If Ping/Pong works well but the connection is broken, the application should be able to re-connect automatically.

### Q4：Why the signature authentication always fail?
A：Please compare  your signature text with below example: 

`GET\n`

`api-cloud.huobi.co.kr\n`

`/v1/account/accounts\n`

`AccessKeyId=rfhxxxxx-950000847-boooooo3-432c0&SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256&SignatureVersion=2&Timestamp=2019-10-28T07%3A28%3A38`

Please check whether you follow below rules:

1、The parameter in signature text should be ordered by ASCII, for example below is the original parameters:

`AccessKeyId=e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx`

`order-id=1234567890`

`SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256`

`SignatureVersion=2`

`Timestamp=2017-05-11T15%3A19%3A30`

They should be ordered like below:

`AccessKeyId=e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx`

`SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256`

`SignatureVersion=2`

`Timestamp=2017-05-11T15%3A19%3A30`

`order-id=1234567890`

2、The signature text should be URI encoded, for example

- The semicolon `:`should be encoded as `%3A`, The space should be encoded as `%20`.
- The timestamp should be formatted as `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss` and after encoded it should be like `2017-05-11T15%3A19%3A30`  

3、The signature should be base64 encoded.

4、The parameter for Get request should be included in signature request.

5、The Timestamp should be UTC time and the format should be YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.

6、The time difference between your timestamp and standard should be less than 1 minute.

7、The message body doesn't need URI encoded if you are using WebSocket for authentication.

8、The host in signature text should be the same as the host in your API request.

9、The hidden text in API Key and Secret Key may have impact on the signature.

Right now the official SDK supports 3 language: Java, Python3 and C++, you can choose the one that suitable for you.

### Q5：Why the API return 'gateway-internal-error'?
A：Please check below possible reasons:

1、Check the `account-id`, it could be returned from `GET /v1/account/accounts`.

2、It may be due to network issue, please try again later.

3、The data format should be correct (standard JSON).

4、The `Content-Type` in POST header should be `application/json` .

### Q6：Why the API return 'login-required'?
A：Please check below possible reasons:

1、The parameter should include `AccessKeyId`.

2、The parameter should include `Signature`.

3、Check the `account-id` it could be returned from `GET /v1/account/accounts`.

4、It may happen if previous request reach the rate limitation.

### Q7: Why the API return HTTP 405 'method-not-allowed'?

A: It indicates the request path doesn't exist, please check the path spelling carefully. Due to the Nginx setting, the request path is case sensitive, please follow the path definition in document.

## Market Data

### Q1：What is the update frequency of market depth?
A：The data is updated **once per second**. But, the BBO (Best Bid/Offer) feed upon WebSocket subscription to `market.$symbol.bbo` is updating in tick by tick mode.

### Q2：Could the total volume of Last 24h Market Summary (GET /v1/market/detail) decrease?
A：Yes, it is possible that the accumulated volume and the accumulated value counted for current 24h window is smaller than previous.

### Q3：How to retrieve the last trade price in market?
A：It is suggested to request to `GET /v1/market/trade` to get last market price, or to subscribe WebSocket topic `market.$symbol.trade.detail` for getting the same.

### Q4：Which timezone the start time of candlesticks falls into?
A： The start time for candlesticks is based on Singapore time (GMT+8), for example, the duration for daily candlesticks is from 00:00:00 to 23:59:59 Singapore time.

## Order and Trade

### Q1：What is account-id?
A： The `account-id` defines the Identity for different business type, it can be retrieved from API `/v1/account/accounts` , where the `account-type` is the business types.

The types include:

- spot: Spot account
- point: Point card account

### Q2：What is client-order-id?
A： The `client-order-id` is an optional request parameter while placing order. It's string type which maximum length is 64. The client order id is generated by client, and is only valid within 24 hours.

### Q3：How to get the order size, price and decimal precision?
A： You can call API `GET /v1/common/symbols` to get the currency pair information, pay attention to the difference between the minimum amount and the minimum price.   

Below are common errors:

- order-value-min-error: The order price is less than minimum price
- order-orderprice-precision-error : The precision for limited order price is wrong 
- order-orderamount-precision-error : The precision for limited order amount is wrong
- order-limitorder-price-max-error : The limited order price is higher than the threshold
- order-limitorder-price-min-error : The limited order price is lower than the threshold
- order-limitorder-amount-max-error : The limited order amount is larger than the threshold
- order-limitorder-amount-min-error : The limited order amount is smaller than the threshold  

### Q4：What is the difference between two WebSocket topic 'orders.\$symbol' and 'orders.\$symbol.update'?
A： Below are the difference:

1、The topic `order.$symbol` is the legacy version, which will be no longer supported in the near future. It is strongly recommended to subscribe topic `orders.$symbol.update` instead for getting order updates.

2、The update message sequence of `orders.$symbol.update` strictly follows transaction time, with lower latency.

3、In order to reduce latency, the topic `orders.$symbol.update` doesn't include original order details and transaction fee etc. If you require the original order information or transaction fee details, you may query to corresponding REST API endpoint.

### Q5：Why I got insufficient balance error while placing an order just after a successful order matching?
A：The time order matching update being sent down, the clearing service of that order may be still in progress at backend. Suggest to follow either of below to ensure a successful order submission:

1、Subscribe to WebSocket topic `accounts` for getting account balance moves to ensure the completion of asset clearing.

2、Check account balance from REST endpoint to ensure sufficient available balance for the next order submission.

3、Leave sufficient balance in your account.

### Q6: What is the difference between 'filled-fees' and 'filled-points' in match result?
A: Transaction fee can be paid from either of below.

1、filled-fees: Filled-fee is also called transaction fee. It's charged from your income currency from the transaction. For example, if your purchase order of BTC/USDT got matched，the transaction fee will be based on BTC.

2、filled-points: If user enabled transaction fee deduction, the fee should be charged from either HT or Point. User could refer to field `fee-deduct-currency` to get the exact deduction type of the transaction.

### Q7: What is the difference between 'match-id' and 'trade-id' in matching result?
A: The `match-id` is the identity for order matching, while the `trade-id` is the unique identifier for each trade. One `match-id` may be correlated with multiple `trade-id`, or no `trade-id`(if the order is cancelled). For example, if a taker's order got matched with 3 maker's orders at the same time, it generates 3 trade IDs but only one match ID.

### Q8: Why the order submission could be rejected even though the order price is set as same as current best bid (or best ask)?
A: For some extreme illiquid trading symbols, the best quote price at particular time might be far away from last trade price. But the price limit is actually based on last trade price which could possibly exclude best quote price from valid range for any new order.

## Deposit and Withdraw

### Q1：Why the API returns error 'api-not-support-temp-addr' when withdrawing?
A：User has to include the address into the pre-defined address table on Huobi Korea official website before withdrawing through API.

### Q2：Why the API returns error 'Invaild-Address' when withdraw USDT?
A：USDT locates on multiple chains, therefore the withdraw order should clearly specify which chain the withdrawal goes to. See the table below:

| Chain           | Field Value |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| ERC20 (default) | `usdterc20`     |
| OMNI            | `usdt`          |
| TRX             | `trc20usdt`     |

If leaving the field empty, default target chain is `ERC20`, or you can explicitly set the chain to `usdterc20`.

If the target chain is `OMNI` or `TRX`, the field value should be `usdt` or `trc20usdt`.

The full chain name list for all currencies can be retrieved from endpoint `GET /v2/reference/currencies`.

### Q3：How to specify 'fee' when creating a withdraw request?

A：Please refer to the response from endpoint `GET /v2/reference/currencies`, where the field `withdrawFeeType` defining different fee types below: 

- transactFeeWithdraw : The withdraw fee per request (only applicable when withdrawFeeType=fixed).      
- minTransactFeeWithdraw : The minimum withdraw fee per request (only applicable when withdrawFeeType=circulated).
- maxTransactFeeWithdraw : The maximum withdraw fee per request (only applicable when withdrawFeeType=circulated or ratio).
- transactFeeRateWithdraw : The withdraw fee rate per request (only applicable when withdrawFeeType=ratio).

### Q4：How to query my withdraw quota?
A：Please refer to the response from endpoint `GET /v2/account/withdraw/quota`, where quota per request, daily quota, annual quota, overall quota are available.

Note: If you need to withdraw large amount which breaking the limitation, you can contact our official support ( API-kr@huobi.com) for assistance.

Note 1:<br>

- If received ‘transaction-amt’ with ‘transact-type’ as ‘rebate’, it implicates a paid maker rebate.<br>
- A paid maker rebate could possibly include rebate from multiple trades.<br>

Note 2:<br>
Only when the number of items within the query window (between “start-time” and ”end-time”) exceeded the page limitation (defined by “size”), Huobi server returns “next-id”. Once received “next-id”, API user should –<br>
1) Be aware of that, some items within the query window were not returned due to the page size limitation.<br>
2) In order to get these items from Huobi server, adopt the “next-id” as “from-id” and submit another request, with other request parameters no change.<br>
3) As database record ID, “next-id” and “from-id” are for recurring query purpose and the ID itself does not have any business implication.<br>

## Point Transfer

Via this endpoint, parent user should be able to transfer points between parent user and sub user, sub user should be able to transfer point to parent user. Both ‘termless’ and ‘terminable’ points are transferrable.<br>
Via this endpoint, user could only transfer ‘termless’ and ‘terminable’ points instead of any other cryptocurrencies.<br>
Parent user could transfer point between parent user and sub user in two ways.<br>
Sub user could only transfer point from sub user to parent user.<br>
Before parent user trying to transfer the terminable points back from sub user's account, parent user should query the sub user's point balance first in order to get the corresponding groupId.<br>

## Search Past Orders

API Key Permission：Read<br>
Rate Limit (NEW): 50times/2s

This endpoint returns orders based on a specific searching criteria. The API created order will not exist after cancelling 2 hours.

- Upon user defined “start-time” AND/OR “end-time”, Huobi server will revert back historical orders whose order creation time falling into the period. The maximum time span between “start-time” and “end-time” is 48-hour. Farthest order searchable should be within recent 180 days. In case either “start-time” or “end-time” is defined, Huobi server will ignore “start-date” and “end-date” regardless they were filled or not.
- If user does neither define “start-time” nor “end-time”, but “start-date”/”end-date”, the order searching will be based on defined “date range”, as usual.
- If user does not define any of “start-time”/”end-time”/”start-date”/”end-date”, by default Huobi server will treat current time as “end-time”, and then revert back historical orders within recent 48 hours.

Huobi Korea suggests API users to search historical orders based on “time” filter instead of “date”. In the near future, Huobi Korea would remove “start-date”/”end-date” fields from the endpoint, through another notification.

# Websocket Market Data

## General

### Websocket URL

**Websocket Market Feed**

**`wss://api-cloud.huobi.co.kr/ws`**


### Data Format

All return data of websocket APIs are compressed with GZIP so they need to be unzipped.

### Heartbeat and Connection

```json
{"ping": 1492420473027} 
```

After connected to Huobi's Websocket server, the server will send heartbeat periodically (currently at 5s interval). The heartbeat message will have an integer in it, e.g.

```json
{"pong": 1492420473027} 
```

When client receives this heartbeat message, it should response with a matching "pong" message which has the same integer in it, e.g.

<aside class="warning">After the server sent two consecutive heartbeat messages without receiving at least one matching "pong" response from a client, then right before server sends the next "ping" heartbeat, the server will disconnect this client</aside>
### Subscribe to Topic

To receive data you have to send a "sub" message first.

```json
{
  "sub": "market.btcusdt.kline.1min",
  "id": "id1"
}
```

{
  "sub": "topic to sub",
  "id": "id generate by client"
}

After successfully subscribed, you will receive a response to confirm subscription

```json
{
  "id": "id1",
  "status": "ok",
  "subbed": "market.btcusdt.kline.1min",
  "ts": 1489474081631
}
```

Then, you will received message when there is update in this topic

### Unsubscribe

## Market By Price (incremental update)

User could subscribe to this channel to receive incremental update of Market By Price order book. Refresh message, the full image of the order book, is acquirable from the same channel, upon "req" request.

**MBP incremental channel & its REQ channel)**

**`wss://api.huobi.co.kr/feed`**
or
**`wss://api-aws.huobi.co.kr/feed`**

Suggested downstream data processing:<br>
1)	Subscribe incremental updates and start to cache them;<br>
2)	Request refresh message (with same number of levels), and base on its “seqNum” to align it with the cached incremental message which having a same “prevSeqNum”;<br>
3)	Start to continuously process incremental messages to build up MBP book;<br>
4)	The “prevSeqNum” of current incremental message must be same with “seqNum” of previous message, otherwise it implicates message loss which should require another round refresh message retrieval and alignment;<br>
5)	Once receiving a new price level from incremental message, that price level should be inserted into appropriate position of existing MBP book;<br>
6)	Once receiving an updated “size” at existing price level from incremental message, the level size should be replaced directly by the new value;<br>
7)	Once receiving a “size=0” at existing price level from incremental message, that price level should be removed from MBP book;<br>
8)	If one incremental message includes updates of multiple price levels, all of those levels should be updated simultaneously in MBP book.<br>

Currently Huobi Korea only supports 5-level/20-level MBP incremental channel and 150-level incremental channel, the differences between them are -<br>
1) Different depth of market.<br>
2) 5-level/20-level incremental MBP is a tick by tick feed, which means whenever there is an order book change at that level, it pushes an update; 150 levels incremental MBP feed is based on the gap between two snapshots at 100ms interval.<br>
3) While there is single side order book update, either bid or ask, the incremental message sent from 5-level/20-level MBP feed only contains that side update. <br>

```json
{
    "ch": "market.btcusdt.mbp.5",
    "ts": 1573199608679,
    "tick": {
        "seqNum": 100020146795,
        "prevSeqNum": 100020146794,
        "asks": [
            [645.140000000000000000, 26.755973959140651643]
        ]
    }
}
```

But the incremental message from 150 levels MBP feed contains not only that side update and also a blank object for another side.

```json
{
    "ch":"market.btcusdt.mbp.150",
    "ts":1573199608679,
    "tick":{
        "seqNum":100020146795,
        "prevSeqNum":100020146794,
        "bids":[ ],
        "asks":[
            [645.14,26.75597395914065]
        ]
    }
}
```

In the near future, Huobi Korea will align the update behavior of 150-level incremental channel with 5-level/20-level, which means while single side order book changed (either bid or ask), the update message will be no longer including a blank object for another side.<br>
4) While there is nothing change between two snapshots in past 100ms, the 150 levels incremental MBP feed still sends out a message which containing two blank objects – bids & asks. <br>

```json
{
    "ch":"market.zecusdt.mbp.150",
    "ts":1585074391470,
    "tick":{
        "seqNum":100772868478,
        "prevSeqNum":100772868476,
        "bids":[  ],
        "asks":[  ]
    }
}
```

But 5-level/20-level incremental channel won’t disseminate any update in such a case.<br>
In the near future, Huobi Korea  will align the update behavior of 150-level incremental channel with 5-level/20-level, which means while there is no order book change at all, the channel will be no longer disseminating blank objects any more.<br>
5) 5-level/20-level incremental channel only supports these symbols at this stage - btcusdt,ethusdt,xrpusdt,eosusdt,ltcusdt,etcusdt,adausdt,dashusdt,bsvusdt, while 150-level incremental channel supports all.<br>

REQ channel supports refreshment message for 5-level, 20-level, and 150-level.

# Websocket Asset and Order (to be obsolete)

## Introduction(to be obsolete)

### Websocket URL

**Websocket Asset and Order**

**`wss://api-cloud.huobi.co.kr/ws/v1`**


### Data Format

All return data of websocket APIs are compressed with GZIP so they need to be unzipped.

### Heartbeat and Connection

**After 2019/07/08**

After connected to Huobi's Websocket server, the server will send heartbeat periodically (at 20s interval). The heartbeat message will have an integer in it, e.g.

> {
    "op":"ping",
    "ts":1492420473027
}

When client receives this heartbeat message, it should response with a matching "pong" message which has the same integer in it, e.g.

> {
    "op":"pong",
    "ts":1492420473027
}

<aside class="warning">After the server sent THREE consective heartbeat messages without receiving at least one matching "pong" response from a client, then right before server sends the next "ping" heartbeat, the server will disconnect this client</aside>
**Prior to 2019/07/08**

After connected to Huobi's Websocket server, the server will send heartbeat periodically (at 30s interval). The heartbeat message will have an integer in it, e.g.

> {
    "op":"ping",
    "ts":1492420473027
}

When client receives this heartbeat message, it should response with a matching "pong" message which has the same integer in it, e.g.

> {
    "op":"pong",
    "ts":1492420473027
}

<aside class="warning">After the server sent two consective heartbeat message without receiving at least one matching "pong" response from a client, then right before server sends the next "ping" heartbeat, the server will disconnect this client</aside>
### Subscribe to Topic

To receive data you have to send a "sub" message first.

```json
{
  "op": "operation type, 'sub' for subscription, 'unsub' for unsubscription",
  "topic": "topic to sub",
  "cid": "id generate by client"
}
```

After successfully subscribed, you will receied a response to confirm subscription

```json
{
  "op": "operation type, refer to the operation which triggers this response",
  "cid": "id1",
  "error-code": 0, // 0 for no error
  "topic": "topic to sub if the op is sub",
  "ts": 1489474081631
}
```

Then, you will received message when there is update in this topic

```json
{
  "op": "notify",
  "topic": "topic of this notify",
  "ts": 1489474082831,
  "data": {
    // data of specific topic update
  }
}
```

### Unsubscribe

To unsubscribe, you need to send below message

```json
{
  "op": "unsub",
  "topic": "accounts",
  "cid": "client generated id"
}
```

And you will receive a message to confirm the unsubscribe

```json
{
  "op": "unsub",
  "topic": "accounts",
  "cid": "id generated by client",
  "err-code": 0,
  "ts": 1489474081631
}
```

### Pull Data

After successfully establishing a connection with the WebSocket API. There are 3 topics which are designed particularly for pull style data query. Those are

* accounts.list
* orders.list
* orders.detail

The details of how to user those three topic will be explain later in this documents.

### Rate Limit

**Rate limt of Subscription for a connection**

The limit is count againt per API key not per connection. When you reached the limit you will receive error with "too many request".

For a given single connection, 
1. maximum of 50 'sub' and 50‘unsub’ in one second. 
2. maximum of 100 sub allowed in total, and every 'unsub' would be deduct from total count of 'sub'. For example, there are 30 sub counts already, if 'unsub' once, then the total count of sub would be 29 for this given connection. When the limit of 100 'sub' reached, no more 'sub' would be allowed. 

**Rate limt of pull style query (req)**

The limit is count againt per API key not per connection. When you reached the limit you will receive error with "too many request".

* accounts.list: once every 2 seconds
* orders.list AND orders.detail: once every 5 seconds

### Authentication

Asset and Order topics require authentication. To authenticate yourself, send below message

```json
{
  "op": "auth",
  "AccessKeyId": "e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx",
  "SignatureMethod": "HmacSHA256",
  "SignatureVersion": "2",
  "Timestamp": "2017-05-11T15:19:30",
  "Signature": "4F65x5A2bLyMWVQj3Aqp+B4w+ivaA7n5Oi2SuYtCJ9o=",
}
```

**The format of Authentication data instruction**

  filed              |type   |  instruction|
  ------------------ |----   |  ----------------------------------------------------- |  ----------------------------------------------------- 
  op                 |string | required; the type of requested operator is auth|
  cid                |string | optional; the ID of Client request|
  AccessKeyId        |string | required; API access key , AccessKey is in APIKEY you applied|
  SignatureMethod    |string | required; the method of sign, user computes signature basing on the protocol of hash ,the api uses HmacSHA256|
  SignatureVersion   |string | required; the version of signature's protocol, the api uses 2|
  Timestamp          |string | required; timestamp, the time is you requests (UTC timezone), this value is to avoid that another people intercepts your request. for example ：2017-05-11T16:22:06 (UTC timezone)|
  Signature          |string |required; signature, the value is computed to make sure that the Authentication is valid and not tampered|

**Notice：**

- Refer to the [Authentication](#authentication) section to generate the signature
- The request method in signature's method is `GET`, WebSocket v1 path is `/ws/v1`
- The data in JSON request doesn't require URL encode

# Websocket Asset and Order (v2)

## Genral

### Access URL

**Websocket Asset and Order (v2)**

**`wss://api-cloud.huobi.co.kr/ws/v2`**  

Note: 
By comparing to api-cloud.huobi.co.kr, the network latency to api-aws.huobi.co.kr is lower, for those client's servers locating at AWS.

### Message Compression

Different with v1, the return data of websocket v2 are not compressed.

### Heartbeat

Once the Websocket connection is established, Huobi server will periodically send "ping" message at 20s interval, with an integer inside.

```json
{
  "action": "ping",
  "data": {
    "ts": 1575537778295
  }
}
```

Once the Websocket connection is established, Huobi server will periodically send "ping" message at 20s interval, with an integer inside.

```json
{
    "action": "ping",
    "data": {
          "ts": 1575537778295 // the same integer from "ping" message
    }
}
```

Once client's server receives "ping", it should respond "pong" message back with the same integer.

### Valid Values of `action`

| Valid Values | Description                                 |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| sub          | Subscribe                                   |
| req          | Request                                     |
| ping,pong    | Heartbeat                                   |
| push         | Push (from Huobi server to client's server) |

### Rate Limit

There are multiple limitations for this version:

- The limitation of single connection for **valid** request (including req, sub, unsub, not including ping/pong or other invalid request) is **50 per second**. It will return "too many request" when the limit is exceeded.
- The limitation of single API Key is **10**. It will return "too many connection" when the limit is exceeded.
- The limitation of single IP is **100 per second**. It will return "too many request" when the limitation is exceeded.

### Authentication

Authentication request:

```json
{
    "action": "req", 
    "ch": "auth",
    "params": { 
        "authType":"api",
        "accessKey": "sffd-ddfd-dfdsaf-dfdsafsd",
        "signatureMethod": "HmacSHA256",
        "signatureVersion": "2.1",
        "timestamp": "2019-09-01T18:16:16",
        "signature": "safsfdsjfljljdfsjfsjfsdfhsdkjfhklhsdlkfjhlksdfh"
    }
}

```

The response of success

```json
{
  "action": "req",
  "code": 200,
  "ch": "auth",
  "data": {}
}
```

Authentication request field list

| Field            | Mandatory | Data Type | Description                                         |
| ---------------- | --------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| action           | true      | string    | Action type, valid value: "req"                     |
| ch               | true      | string    | Channel, valid value: "auth"                        |
| authType         | true      | string    | Authentication type, valid value: "api"             |
| accessKey        | true      | string    | Access key                                          |
| signatureMethod  | true      | string    | Signature method, valid value: "HmacSHA256"         |
| signatureVersion | true      | string    | Signature version, valid value: "2.1"               |
| timestamp        | true      | string    | Timestamp in UTC in format like 2017-05-11T16:22:06 |
| signature        | true      | string    | Signature                                           |

### Generating Signature 

The signature generation method v2.1 is similar with v2.0, with only following differences:

1. The request method should be "GET", to URL "/ws/v2".
2. The involved field names in v2 signature generation are: accessKey，signatureMethod，signatureVersion，timestamp
3. The valid value of signatureVersion is 2.1.

Please refer to detailed signature generation steps from: [https://alphaex-api.github.io/openapi/spot/v1/en/#authentication]

The final string involved in signature generation should be like below:

```
GET\n
api-cloud.huobi.co.kr\n
/ws/v2\n
accessKey=0664b695-rfhfg2mkl3-abbf6c5d-49810&signatureMethod=HmacSHA256&signatureVersion=2.1&timestamp=2019-12-05T11%3A53%3A03
```

The final string involved in signature generation should be like below:

Note: The data in JSON request doesn't require URL encode

### Subscribe a Topic to Continuously Receive Updates

> Sub request:

```json
{
	"action": "sub",
	"ch": "accounts.update"
}
```

Once the Websocket connection is established, Websocket client could send following request to subscribe a topic:

> Sub respose:

```json
{
	"action": "sub",
	"code": 200,
	"ch": "accounts.update#0",
	"data": {}
}
```

Upon success, Websocket client should receive a response below:

## Subscribe Order Updates

API Key Permission: Read

An order update can be triggered by any of following:<br>

- Conditional order triggering failure (eventType=trigger)<br>
- Conditional order cancellation before trigger (eventType=deletion)<br>
- Order creation (eventType=creation)<br>
- Order matching (eventType=trade)<br>
- Order cancellation (eventType=cancellation)<br>

The field list in order update message can be various per event type, developers can design the data structure in either of two ways:<br>

- Define a data structure including fields for all event types, allowing a few of them null<br>
- Define different data structure for each event type to include specific fields, inheriting from a common data structure which has common fields

## Subscribe Trade Details & Order Cancellation post Clearing

API Key Permission: Read

Only update when order transaction or cancellation. Order transaction update is in tick by tick mode, which means, if a taker’s order matches with multiple maker’s orders, the simultaneous multiple trades will be disseminated one by one. But, the update sequence of the multiple trades, may not be exactly same with the sequence of the transactions made. Also, if an order is auto cancelled immediately just after its partial fills, for example a typical IOC order, this channel would be possibly disseminate the cancellation update first prior to the trade. <br>

If user willing to receive order updates in exact same sequence with the original happening, it is recommended to subscribe order update channel orders#${symbol}.<br>
